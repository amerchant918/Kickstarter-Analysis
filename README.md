The venture that Louise has chosen has great potential for success. Her choice of Theater/Plays as a Category/Subcategory has the highest success rate in the US. However it also contributes as the highest failed rate. That being said I would recommend Louise to manage her risk by taking into account further metrics such as the campaign launch date and goal amount. 
### Challenge
#### Conducting Analysis of Kickstarter Play campaigns to provide Louise with insight on relatable campaigns
After analyzing the Kickstarter dataset I am now able to provide Louise guidance to get her Play started. My first recommendation to Louise would be to prepare the launch of her campaign in the month of May. Per visual 1 below the month of May has proven to be the most successful. My second recommendation for Louise would be to manage a budget of less than 5,000 USD in order to succeed like the other relatable campaigns in Visual 2 that have a goal of 5,000 USD or less. My last recommendation for Louise is to set her campaign length to be around 29 days as that has shown the most success in timing for comparable campaigns.
Although the data was helpful in getting a broad understanding of how Kickstarter campaigns perform and what it takes to succeed in one. I believe with a deeper analysis into the details Louise would have a more relevant understanding of what she needs to prepare for. After analyzing the Kickstarter site it would be helpful to include as part of the analysis the number of backers that support a pledge with or without a reward.  Another aspect of a detailed analysis would be to learn which genres are receiving the most amount of pledge and backers to determine the most interest and aligning her vision with the audience's request. Looking at the picture as a whole will guide Louise to better kick start her Kickstarter campaign.
