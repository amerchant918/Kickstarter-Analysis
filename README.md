The venture that Louise has chosen has great potential for success. Her choice of Theater/Plays as a Category/Subcategory has the highest success rate in the US. However it also contributes as the highest failed rate. That being said I would recommend Louise to manage her risk by taking into account further metrics such as the campaign launch date and goal amount. 
### Challenge
#### Conducting Analysis of Kickstarter Play campaigns to provide Louise with insight on relatable campaigns
